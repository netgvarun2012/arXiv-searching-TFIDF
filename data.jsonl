In order to provide an\nhomogenous sample, reduced and analyzed using the same procedure, we present in\nthis paper the new reduction and analysis for a set of 97 galaxies already\npublished in previous papers but now using the new data reduction procedure\nadopted for the whole sample. The GHASP survey is now achieved and the whole\nsample is reduced using adaptive binning techniques based on Voronoi\ntessellations. We have derived Ha data cubes from which are computed Ha maps,\nradial velocity fields as well as residual velocity fields, position-velocity\ndiagrams, rotation curves and kinematical parameters for almost all galaxies.\nThe rotation curves, the kinematical parameters and their uncertainties are\ncomputed homogeneously using the new method based on the power spectrum of the\nresidual velocity field. This paper provides the kinematical parameters for the\nwhole sample. For the first time, the integrated Ha profiles have been computed\nand are presented for the whole sample. The total Ha fluxes deduced from these\nprofiles have been used in order to provide a flux calibration for the 203\nGHASP galaxies. This paper confirms the conclusions already drawn from half the\nsample concerning (i) the increased accuracy of position angles measurements\nusing kinematical data, (ii) the difficulty to have robust determinations of\nboth morphological and kinematical inclinations in particular for low\ninclination galaxies and (iii) the very good agreement between the Tully-Fisher\nrelationship derived from our data and previous determinations.\n", "categories": "Astrophysics "}

The ~20-minute long flare of July 9 showed\nan indication of a 4 +/- 1 min time delay between the peaks of F(<0.25 TeV) and\nF(>1.2 TeV), which may indicate a progressive acceleration of electrons in the\nemitting plasma blob. The flux variability was quantified for several energy\nranges, and found to increase with the energy of the gamma-ray photons. The\nspectra hardened significantly with increasing flux, and during the two most\nactive nights, a spectral peak was clearly detected at 0.43 +/- 0.06 TeV and\n0.25 +/- 0.07 TeV, respectively for June 30 and July 9.

It also has two unusual optical features\nwithin the radius of the radio jet (~1\"): (1) an anomalous, high-velocity\nnarrow-line component, having several times as much flux as does the\nnarrow-line component coinciding with the broad-line redshift; and (2) a bright\ncontinuum peak (3C48A) ~1\" northeast of the quasar. Both of these optical\nfeatures have been conjectured to be related to the radio jet. Here we explore\nthese suggestions. We have obtained Gemini North GMOS integral-field-unit (IFU)\nspectroscopy of the central region around 3C48. We use the unique features of\nthe IFU data to remove unresolved emission at the position of the quasar. The\nresolved emission at the wavelength of the high-velocity component is peaked\n<~0.25\" north of the quasar, at virtually the same position angle as the base\nof the radio jet. These observations appear to confirm that this high-velocity\ngas is connected with the radio jet. However, most of the emission comes from a\nregion where the jet is still well collimated, rather than from the regions\nwhere the radio maps indicate strong interaction with an external medium. We\nalso present the results of HST STIS spectroscopy of 3C48A. We show that 3C48A\nis dominated by stars with a luminosity-weighted age of ~1.4 X 10^8 years,\nsubstantially older than any reasonable estimate for the age of the radio\nsource. Our IFU data indicate a similar age. Thus, 3C48A almost certainly\ncannot be attributed to jet-induced star formation.

Along the way, we introduce new methods for analyzing\nnoncontextuality scenarios, and demonstrate a tight connection between our\nminimum error state discrimination scenario and a Bell scenario.\n", "categories": "Quantum Physics "}

{"id": 956488, "title": "A Low-rank Tensor Regularization Strategy for Hyperspectral Unmixing", "abstract": "  Tensor-based methods have recently emerged as a more natural and effective\nformulation to address many problems in hyperspectral imaging. In hyperspectral\nunmixing (HU), low-rank constraints on the abundance maps have been shown to\nact as a regularization which adequately accounts for the multidimensional\nstructure of the underlying signal. However, imposing a strict low-rank\nconstraint for the abundance maps does not seem to be adequate, as important\ninformation that may be required to represent fine scale abundance behavior may\nbe discarded. This paper introduces a new low-rank tensor regularization that\nadequately captures the low-rank structure underlying the abundance maps\nwithout hindering the flexibility of the solution. Simulation results with\nsynthetic and real data show that the the extra flexibility introduced by the\nproposed regularization significantly improves the unmixing results.\n", "categories": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"}

{"id": 1447798, "title": "Online Multiple Object Tracking with Cross-Task Synergy", "abstract": "  Modern online multiple object tracking (MOT) methods usually focus on two\ndirections to improve tracking performance. One is to predict new positions in\nan incoming frame based on tracking information from previous frames, and the\nother is to enhance data association by generating more discriminative identity\nembeddings. Some works combined both directions within one framework but\nhandled them as two individual tasks, thus gaining little mutual benefits. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel unified model with synergy between position\nprediction and embedding association. The two tasks are linked by\ntemporal-aware target attention and distractor attention, as well as\nidentity-aware memory aggregation model. Specifically, the attention modules\ncan make the prediction focus more on targets and less on distractors,\ntherefore more reliable embeddings can be extracted accordingly for\nassociation. On the other hand, such reliable embeddings can boost\nidentity-awareness through memory aggregation, hence strengthen attention\nmodules and suppress drifts. In this way, the synergy between position\nprediction and embedding association is achieved, which leads to strong\nrobustness to occlusions.

We demonstrated this theory\nwith a $\\textrm{FExSCA}^2$ approach to study the 3-scale woven carbon fiber\nreinforced polymer (CFRP) laminate structure. $\\textrm{FExSCA}^2$ significantly\nreduced expensive 3D nested composite representative volume elements (RVEs)\ncomputation for woven and unidirectional (UD) composite structures by\ndeveloping a material database. The modeling procedure is established by\nintegrating the material database into a woven CFRP structural numerical model,\nformulating a concurrent 3-scale modeling framework. This framework provides an\naccurate prediction for the structural performance (e.g., nonlinear structural\nbehavior under tensile load), as well as the woven and UD physics field\nevolution. The concurrent modeling results are validated against physical tests\nthat link structural performance to the basic material microstructures.

Here, we report the\nrobustness of the interfacial superconductivity and 2D vortex dynamics in four\nas-grown and aged Bi2Te3/FeTe heterostructure with different Bi2Te3 epilayer\nthickness (3, 5, 7, 14 nm). After two years' air exposure, superconductivity\nremains robust even when the thickness of Bi2Te3 epilayer is down to 3 nm.\nMeanwhile, a new feature at ~13 K is induced in the aged samples, and the high\nfield studies reveal its relevance to superconductivity. The resistance of all\nas-grown and aged heterostructures, just below the superconducting transition\ntemperature follows the Arrhenius relation, indicating the thermally activated\nflux flow behavior at the interface of Bi2Te3 and FeTe. Moreover, the\nactivation energy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the magnetic field,\nproviding a compelling evidence for the 2D vortex dynamics in this novel\nsystem.

Extensive\nmeasurements have been made on highly-ordered compounds having the L12 crystal\nstructure, including In3R, Sn3R, Ga3R, Al3R and Pd3R phases (R= rare-earth\nelement). Measurements in thermal equilibrium at high temperature served to\ndetermine lattice locations of 111In parent probe-atoms, through characteristic\nNQIs, and to measure diffusional jump-frequencies of 111Cd daughter\nprobe-atoms, through relaxation of the NQI. This paper summarizes results of\nthe jump-frequency measurements and relates them to the conventional\ndiffusivity. ... A change in diffusion mechanism was proposed in 2009 to\nexplain jump-frequency systematics for In3R phases. An alternative explanation\nis proposed in the present paper based on site-preferences of 111Cd daughter\nprobes newly observed along the parallel Pd3R series. The diffusivity can be\nexpressed as the product of a jump-frequency such as measured in these studies\nand a correlation factor for diffusion that depends on the diffusion mechanism.\nThe correlation factor can be modeled for the L12 structure and diffusion\nsublattice of interest using a five-frequency model originally proposed for\nmetals. Although the correlation factor is an essential parameter for the\ndiffusion of impurities, it has never been measured. It is suggested that\nvalues of the correlation factor can be determined feasibly by combining\nresults of jump-frequency measurements such as the present ones with\ndiffusivity measurements made for the same host-impurity systems.\n", "categories": "Materials Science"}

The lowest hole subband in Si/SiGe quantum\nwells is light-hole like with the Rashba spin-orbit coupling term depending on\nmomentum both linearly and cubically, while that in Ge/SiGe quantum wells is a\nheavy hole state with the Rashba spin-orbit coupling term depending on momentum\nonly cubically. The hole spin relaxation is investigated by means of the fully\nmicroscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation approach, with all the relevant\nscatterings considered.

The\nhole system in Si/SiGe quantum wells is generally in the strong scattering\nlimit, while that in Ge/SiGe quantum wells can be in either the strong or the\nweak scattering limit.

It can then be speculated that in modified theories of gravity, the\nmemory can differ from the GR prediction, and provides novel phenomena to study\nthese theories. We support this speculation by considering scalar-tensor\ntheories, for which we find two new types of memory: the T memory and the S\nmemory, which contribute to the tensor and scalar components of gravitational\nwave, respectively. In particular, the former is caused by the burst of energy\ncarried away by scalar radiation, while the latter is intimately related to the\nno scalar hair property of black holes in scalar-tensor gravity. We estimate\nthe size of these two types of memory in gravitational collapses, and formulate\na detection strategy for the S memory, which can be singled out from tensor\ngravitational waves.

This trend is not seen in\nspectroscopically classified samples, and is unlikely to be entirely explained\nby orientation effects. In addition, outflow velocities increase from small to\nmoderate AGN $E(B-V)$ values, before flattening out (as traced by FWHM) and\neven decreasing (as traced by blueshift). While difficult to fully interpret in\na single physical model, due to both the averaging over populations and the\nspatially-averaged spectra, these results agree with previous findings that\nsimple geometric unification models are insufficient for the IR-selected AGN\npopulation, and may fit into an evolutionary model for obscured and unobscured\nAGN.\n", "categories": "Astrophysics of Galaxies"}

In this paper, we propose a simple model of\ndust enrichment in a galaxy with a simplified treatment of grain size\ndistribution by imposing a `two-size approximation'; that is, all the grain\npopulation is represented by small (grain radius a < 0.03 micron) and large (a\n> 0.03 micron) grains. We include in the model dust supply from stellar ejecta,\ndestruction in supernova shocks, dust growth by accretion, grain growth by\ncoagulation and grain disruption by shattering, considering how these processes\nwork on the small and large grains. We show that this simple framework\nreproduces the main features found in full calculations of grain size\ndistributions as follows. The dust enrichment starts with the supply of large\ngrains from stars. At a metallicity level referred to as the critical\nmetallicity of accretion, the abundance of the small grains formed by\nshattering becomes large enough to rapidly increase the grain abundance by\naccretion. Associated with this epoch, the mass ratio of the small grains to\nthe large grains reaches the maximum. After that, this ratio converges to the\nvalue determined by the balance between shattering and coagulation, and the\ndust-to-metal ratio is determined by the balance between accretion and shock\ndestruction. With a Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that the simplicity\nof our model has an advantage in predicting statistical properties. We also\nshow some applications for predicting observational dust properties such as\nextinction curves.\n", "categories": "Astrophysics of Galaxies"}

The probability distribution function (PDF) of column\ndensities for all clouds have a power-law distribution over all (high) column\ndensities, regardless of the evolutionary stage of the cloud: G11.11-0.12,\nG18.82-0.28, and G28.37+0.07 contain (proto)-stars, while G28.53-0.25 shows no\nsigns of star formation. This is in contrast to the purely log-normal PDFs\nreported for near/mid-IR extinction maps. We only find a log-normal\ndistribution for lower column densities, if we perform PDFs of the column\ndensity maps of the whole GMC in which the IRDCs are embedded. By comparing the\nPDF slope and the radial column density profile, we attribute the power law to\nthe effect of large-scale gravitational collapse and to local free-fall\ncollapse of pre- and protostellar cores. Independent from the PDF analysis, we\nfind infall signatures in the spectral profiles of 12CO for G28.37+0.07 and\nG11.11-0.12, supporting the scenario of gravitational collapse. IRDCs are the\ndensest regions within GMCs, which may be the progenitors of massive stars or\nclusters.

The presence of a 110 kpc long HI tail in the S\ndirection indicates that this galaxy is undergoing a ram pressure stripping\nevent. The deep narrow-band image revealed the presence of a low surface\nbrightness ionised gas tail ~10 kpc long extending from the centre of the\ngalaxy to the NW direction, in the direction opposite to the HI tail. Chandra\nand XMM X-rays data do not show any compact source in the nucleus nor the\npresence of an extended tail of hot gas, while MUSE spectroscopy indicates that\nthe gas is photo-ionised in the inner regions and shock-ionised in the outer\nparts. IFU spectroscopy confirms that the ionised gas is kinematically\ndecoupled from the stellar component and indicates the presence of two\nkinematically distinct structures in the stellar disc. The analysis of the SED\nof the galaxy indicates that the activity of star formation has been totally\nquenched in the outer disc ~ 250-280 Myr ago, while only reduced by ~80% in the\ncentral regions. All this observational evidence suggests that NGC 4424 is the\nremnant of an unequal-mass merger occurred <= 500 Myr ago, when the galaxy was\nalready a member of the Virgo cluster, now undergoing a ram pressure stripping\nevent which has removed the gas and quenched the activity of star formation in\nthe outer disc. The tail of ionised gas probably results from the outflow\nproduced by a central starburst fed by the collapse of gas induced by the\nmerging episode. This outflow is sufficiently powerful to overcome the ram\npressure induced by the intracluster medium on the disc of the galaxy crossing\nthe cluster.

We combine high resolution [CII] spectra taken with the\nHIFI spectrometer onboard the Herschel satellite with [CII] Herschel-PACS maps\nand ground-based observations of CO(2-1) and HI. All data are at a common\nspatial resolution of 50pc. Typically, the [CII] lines have widths intermediate\nbetween the narrower CO(2-1) and broader HI line profiles. We decomposed the\n[CII] spectra in terms of contribution from molecular and atomic gas detected\nin CO(2-1) and HI, respectively. We find that the relative contribution of\nmolecular and atomic gas traced by CO(2-1) and HI varies depends mostly on the\nlocal physical conditions and geometry.

The deduced strong variation in the [CII] emission not\nassociated with CO and HI cannot be explained in terms of differences in A_v,\nfar-ultraviolet radiation field, and metallicity between the two studied\nregions. Hence the relative amounts of diffuse (CO-dark) and dense molecular\ngas possibly vary on spatial scales smaller than 50pc.

Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO\ntowards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water\nformation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral\nsurvey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the\nCHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of\nnumerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with\nground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code\nRATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an\nabundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a\nsimilar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope\nlines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of\n1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption\nlines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It\nmay correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices\nat the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot\ncorino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8%\nin the added absorbing layer. Although it is clearly higher than the cosmic D/H\nabundance, the HDO/H2O ratio remains lower than the D/H ratio derived for other\ndeuterated molecules observed in the same source. The similarity of the ratios\nderived in the hot corino and in the added absorbing layer suggests that water\nformed before the gravitational collapse of the protostar, contrary to\nformaldehyde and methanol, which formed later once the CO molecules had\ndepleted on the grains.\n", "categories": "Astrophysics of Galaxies"}

Our goal is to explore whether a significant accreted (or ex-situ)\nstellar component in the Milky Way disc could be hidden within the\nnear-circular orbit population, which is strongly dominated by stars born\nin-situ. One third of our models shows a significant ex-situ disc but this\nfraction would be larger if constraints on orbital circularity were relaxed.\nMost of the ex-situ material ($\\gtrsim 50\\%$) comes from single massive\nsatellites ($> 6 \\times 10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$). These satellites are accreted with\na wide range of infall times and inclination angles (up to $85^{\\circ}$).\nEx-situ discs are thicker, older and more metal-poor than their in-situ\ncounterparts. They show a flat median age profile, which differs from the\nnegative gradient observed in the in-situ component. As a result, the\nlikelihood of identifying an ex-situ disc in samples of old stars on\nnear-circular orbits increases towards the outskirts of the disc. We show three\nexamples that, in addition to ex-situ discs, have a strongly rotating dark\nmatter component. Interestingly, two of these ex-situ stellar discs show an\norbital circularity distribution that is consistent with that of the in-situ\ndisc. Thus, they would not be detected in typical kinematic studies.\n", "categories": "Astrophysics of Galaxies"}

We find that disks of initial mass 0.1M_o around\n1M_o stars survive for 4x10^6 years, assuming a viscosity parameter\n$\\alpha=0.01$, a time-dependent FUV luminosity $L_{FUV}~10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ L_o\nand with X-ray and EUV luminosities $L_X \\sim L_{EUV} ~ 10^{-3}$L_o. We find\nthat FUV/X-ray-induced photoevaporation and viscous accretion are both\nimportant in depleting disk mass. Photoevaporation rates are most significant\nat ~ 1-10 AU and at >~ 30 AU. Viscosity spreads the disk which causes mass loss\nby accretion onto the central star and feeds mass loss by photoevaporation in\nthe outer disk. We find that FUV photons can create gaps in the inner,\nplanet-forming regions of the disk (~ 1-10 AU) at relatively early epochs in\ndisk evolution while disk masses are still substantial. EUV and X-ray photons\nare also capable of driving gaps, but EUV can only do so at late, low\naccretion-rate epochs after the disk mass has already declined substantially.\nDisks around stars with predominantly soft X-ray fields experience enhanced\nphotoevaporative mass loss.

We study the evolution of rotation and high energy X-ray, extreme\nultraviolet (EUV), and Ly-alpha emission for F, G, K, and M dwarfs, with masses\nbetween 0.1 and 1.2 Msun, and provide our evolutionary code and a freely\navailable set of evolutionary tracks for use in planetary atmosphere studies.\n  Methods. We develop a physical rotational evolution model constrained by\nobserved rotation distributions in young stellar clusters. Using rotation,\nX-ray, EUV, and Ly-alpha measurements, we derive empirical relations for the\ndependences of high energy emission on stellar parameters. Our description of\nX-ray evolution is validated using measurements of X-ray distributions in young\nclusters.\n  Results. A star's X-ray, EUV, and Ly-alpha evolution is determined by its\nmass and initial rotation rate, with initial rotation being less important for\nlower mass stars. At all ages, solar mass stars are significantly more X-ray\nluminous than lower mass stars and stars that are born as rapid rotators remain\nhighly active longer than those born as slow rotators. At all evolutionary\nstages, habitable zone planets receive higher X-ray and EUV fluxes when\norbiting lower mass stars due to their longer evolutionary timescales. The\nrates of flares follow similar evolutionary trends with higher mass stars\nflaring more often than lower mass stars at all ages, though habitable zone\nplanets are likely influenced by flares more when orbiting lower mass stars.\n  Conclusions. Our results show that single decay-laws are insufficient to\ndescribe stellar activity evolution and highlight the need for a more\ncomprehensive description based on the evolution of rotation, including also\nthe effects of short-term variability. Planets at similar orbital distances\nfrom their host stars receive significantly more X-ray and EUV energy over\ntheir lifetimes when orbiting higher mass stars.

However, in the ultraviolet the flux\nemitted by a secondary with T eff > 5500 ~ 6000 K may prevail over that of the\nprimary, and then it can be used to search for candidates to binary AGB stars.\nIn this work, theoretical atmosphere models are used to calculate the UV excess\nin the GALEX near- and far-UV bands due to a main-sequence companion.

Mass loss,\n  envelope inflation, and a variable upper stellar mass limit", "abstract": "  The identification of stellar-mass black-hole mergers with up to 80 Msun as\npowerful sources of gravitational wave radiation led to increased interest in\nthe physics of the most massive stars. The largest sample of possible\nprogenitors of such objects, very massive stars (VMS) with masses up to 300\nMsun, have been identified in the 30 Dor star-forming region in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC). The physics and evolution of VMS is highly uncertain,\nmainly due to their proximity to the Eddington limit. In this work we\ninvestigate the two most important effects that are thought to occur near the\nEddington limit. Enhanced mass loss through optically thick winds, and the\nformation of radially inflated stellar envelopes. We compute evolutionary\nmodels for VMS at LMC metallicity and perform a population synthesis of the\nyoung stellar population in 30 Dor. We find that enhanced mass loss and\nenvelope inflation have a dominant effect on the evolution of the most massive\nstars. While the observed mass-loss properties and the associated surface\nHe-enrichment are well described by our new models, the observed O-star\nmass-loss rates are found to cover a much larger range than theoretically\npredicted, with particularly low mass-loss rates for the youngest objects.\nAlso, the (rotational) surface enrichment in the O-star regime appears to be\nnot well understood. The positions of the most massive stars in the\nHertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) are affected by mass loss and envelope\ninflation. For instance, the majority of luminous B-supergiants in 30 Dor, and\nthe lack thereof at the highest luminosities, can be explained through the\ncombination of envelope inflation and mass loss. Finally, we find that the\nupper limit for the inferred initial stellar masses in the greater 30 Dor\nregion is significantly lower than in its central cluster R 136, implying a\nvariable upper limit for the masses of stars.\n", "categories": "Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"}

The\ngeneral expectation has been that the atmospheres of those substellar-mass\nobjects with condensate clouds would give rise to linear polarization due to\nscattering. Because of rotation-induced non-sphericity, there is expected to be\nincomplete cancellation of disk-integrated net polarization and thus a finite\npolarization. For cloudless objects, however, only molecular Rayleigh\nscattering will contribute to any net polarization and this limit has not been\nwell studied. Hence in this paper we present a detailed multiple scattering\nanalysis of the polarization expected from those T-dwarfs whose spectra show\nabsence of condensates. For this, we develop and solve the full radiative\ntransfer equations for linearly polarized radiation. Only atomic and molecular\nRayleigh scattering are considered to be the source of polarization. We compute\nthe local polarization at different angular directions in a plane-parallel\natmospheres calculated for the range of effective temperatures of T dwarfs and\nthen average over the whole surface of the object. The effects of gravity and\nlimb darkening as well as rotation induced non-sphericity are included. It is\nfound that the amount of polarization decreases with the increase in effective\ntemperature. It is also found that significant polarization at any local point\nin the atmosphere arises only in the optical (B-band). However, the disk\nintegrated polarization--even in the B-band--is negligible. Hence we conclude\nthat, unlike the case for cloudy L dwarfs, polarization of cloudless T-dwarfs\nby atomic and molecular scattering may not be detectable.\n", "categories": "Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"}

While the Sun has been the subject of intense research for\nrefining dynamo models, observations of magnetic cyclic activity in solar type\nstars have become more and more available, opening a new path to understand the\nunderlying physics behind stellar cycles. For instance, it is key to understand\nhow stellar rotation rate influences magnetic cycle period $\\Pcyc$. Recent\nnumerical simulations of advection-dominated Babcock Leighton models have\ndemonstrated that it is difficult to explain this observed trend given a) the\nstrong influence of the cycle period to the meridional circulation amplitude\nand b) the fact that 3D models indicate that meridional flows become weaker as\nthe rotation rate increases. In this paper, we introduce the turbulent pumping\nmechanism as another advective process capable also of transporting the\nmagnetic fields. We found that this model is now able to reproduce the\nobservations under the assumption that this effect increases as $\\Omega^2$. The\nturbulent pumping becomes indeed another major player able to circumvent the\nmeridional circulation. However, for high rotation rates ($\\Omega \\simeq 5\n\\Omega_\\odot$), its effects dominate those of the meridional circulation,\nentering a new class of regime dominated by the advection of turbulent pumping\nand thus leading to a cyclic activity qualitatively different from that of the\nsun.\n", "categories": "Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"}

Although prior works have\nemployed the IRS to enhance the system performance under various setups, the\nfundamental capacity limits of an IRS aided multi-antenna multi-user system\nhave not yet been characterized. Motivated by this, we investigate an IRS aided\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel by considering the\ncapacity-achieving dirty paper coding (DPC) scheme and dynamic beamforming\nconfigurations. We first propose a bisection based framework to characterize\nits capacity region by optimally solving the sum-rate maximization problem\nunder a set of rate constraints, which is also applicable to characterize the\nachievable rate region with the zero-forcing (ZF) scheme.

SNR shocks then expand\nfrom the cluster into the strongly magnetised wind and accelerate nuclei up to\nultra-high energies. This population, representing only about 15% of all\nGalactic massive star clusters, nevertheless dominates the spectrum between ~ 1\nand 100 PeV.

We find two anomalous features in the system's behavior. First, the\npulse profile observed by NICER during maximum luminosity is similar to that\nobserved by XMM-Newton in 2000, despite the fact that the X-ray luminosity was\ndifferent by two orders of magnitude. By contrast, a modest decrease in\nluminosity in the 2020 observations generated a significant change in pulse\nprofile. Second, we find that the historical optical outbursts are not strictly\nperiodic, as would be expected if the outbursts were triggered by periastron\npassage, as is generally assumed. The optical peaks are also not coincident\nwith the X-ray outbursts. We suggest that this behavior may result from a\nmisalignment of the Be star disk and the orbital plane, which might cause\nchanges in the timing of the passage of the neutron star through the disk as it\nprecesses. We conclude that the orbital period of the source remains unclear.\n", "categories": "High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"}

The soft component (kT~0.2 keV), fitted by the APEC model,\nis well described by plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium with\nabundances consistent with solar values.

In\nthis paper we discuss various ways of using these high resolution data to\nconstrain velocity power spectrum in galaxy clusters. We argue that variations\nof these quantities with the projected distance R in cool core clusters contain\nimportant information on the velocity field length scales in the ICM. The\neffective length $l_{\\rm eff}$ along the line of sight, which provides dominant\ncontribution to the line flux, increases with R, allowing one to probe the\namplitude of the velocity variations at different spatial scales. In\nparticular, we show that the width of the line as a function of R is closely\nlinked to the structure function of the 3D velocity field. Yet another easily\nobtainable proxy of the velocity field length scales is the ratio of the\namplitude of the projected velocity field (line energy) variations to the\ndispersion of the velocity along the line of sight (line width). Finally the\nprojected velocity field can be easily converted into 3D velocity field,\nespecially for clusters like Coma with an extended flat core in the surface\nbrightness. Under assumption of a homogeneous isotropic Gaussian 3D velocity\nfield we derived simple expressions relating the power spectrum of the 3D\nvelocity field (or structure function) and the observables. The uncertainties\nin the observables, caused by stochastic nature of the velocity field, are\nestimated by making multiple realizations of the random Gaussian velocity field\nand evaluating the scatter in observables.

In this paper, key predictions of DSA at relativistic\nshocks that are germane to production of relativistic electrons and ions are\noutlined. The technique employed to identify these characteristics is a Monte\nCarlo simulation of such diffusive acceleration in test-particle, relativistic,\noblique, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks. Using a compact prescription for\ndiffusion of charges in MHD turbulence, this approach generates particle\nangular and momentum distributions at any position upstream or downstream of\nthe shock.

We characterize the diffuse TeV flux from the Galaxy\nusing decade-long exposures of the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Considering that\nthe level of diffuse Galactic emission in the TeV band approaches the level of\nresidual cosmic-ray background, we estimated the level of residual cosmic-ray\nbackground in the SOURCEVETO event selection and verified that the TeV diffuse\nGalactic emission flux is well above the residual cosmic-ray background up to\nhigh Galactic latitude regions.

This method may be more\nsimple, and closer to realistic equation of state\\,(EoS) of a neutron star(NS),\nbecause there are linear or quasi-linear relationships between number fractions\nof leptons and matter density, which can be seen by solving NS EoS; (2)we\nintroduce a dimensionless variable $\\varrho$\\,($\\varrho=\\rho/\\rho_0$,\n$\\rho_{0}$ is the standard saturated nuclear density), which greatly reduces\nthe scope of the fitting coefficients;(3)we present numerical errors including\nabsolute and relative deviations between the data and fit. By numerically\nsimulating, we have obtained several analytical formulae for $Y_{e}$ and $\\rho$\nfor both APR98 and RMF models. Combining these analytical formulae with the\nspecial solution, we can calculate the value of $E_{\\rm F}(e)$ for any given\nmatter density.

Broad-lined type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-BL) are a subclass of SNe that are not\nall exclusively powered by 56Ni decay. It was suggested that some SNe Ic-BL are\npowered by magnetar spin-down. iPTF16asu is a peculiar broad-lined type Ic\nsupernova discovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory. With a\nrest-frame rise time of only 4 days, iPTF16asu challenges the existing popular\nmodels, for example, the radioactive heating (56Ni-only) and the magnetar+56Ni\nmodels. Here we show that this rapid rise could be attributed to interaction\nbetween the SN ejecta and a pre-existing circumstellar medium ejected by the\nprogenitor during its final stages of evolution, while the late-time light\ncurve can be better explained by energy input from a rapidly spinning magnetar.\nThis model is a natural extension to the previous magnetar model. The mass-loss\nrate of the progenitor and ejecta mass are consistent with a progenitor that\nexperienced a common envelope evolution in a binary. An alternative model for\nthe early rapid rise of the light curve is the cooling of a shock propagating\ninto an extended envelope of the progenitor. It is difficult at this stage to\ntell which model (interaction+magnetar+56Ni or cooling+magnetar+56Ni) is better\nfor iPTF16asu. However, it is worth noting that the inferred envelope mass in\nthe cooling+magnetar+56Ni is very high.\n", "categories": "High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"}

Extended regions with a high\nconcentration of galaxies are called 'superclusters', although this term is not\nprecise. There is, however, another way to analyse the structure. If the\ndistance to each galaxy from Earth is directly measured, then the peculiar\nvelocity can be derived from the subtraction of the mean cosmic expansion, the\nproduct of distance times the Hubble constant, from observed velocity. The\npeculiar velocity is the line-of-sight departure from the cosmic expansion and\narises from gravitational perturbations; a map of peculiar velocities can be\ntranslated into a map of the distribution of matter.

While the\nconnected covariance only becomes important on small scales, the disconnected\ncovariance is dominant on large scales, where the survey window has a\nsignificant impact. In this work, we develop an analytical method to compute\nthe disconnected covariance, accounting for the window effect. Derived under\nthe flat-sky approximation, our formalism is applicable to wide surveys by\nswapping in the curved-sky window functions. Our method works for both the\npower spectrum and the correlation function, and applies to the covariances of\nvarious probes including the multipoles and the wedges of 3D clustering, the\nangular and the projected statistics of clustering and shear, as well as the\ncross covariances between different probes. We verify the analytic covariance\nagainst the sample covariance from the galaxy mock simulations in two test\ncases: (1) the power spectrum multipole covariance, and (2) the joint\ncovariance of the projected correlation function and the correlation function\nmultipoles. Our method achieve good agreement with the mocks, while at a\nnegligible computational cost. Unlike mocks, our analytic covariance is free of\nsampling noise, which often leads to numerical problems and the need to inflate\nthe errors. In addition, our method can use the best-fit power spectrum as\ninput, in contrast to the standard procedure of using a fiducial model that may\ndeviate significantly from the truth.

We identify which stellar populations are responsible for\nmost of the 12um emission. We find that most (~80%) of the 12um emission in SF\ngalaxies is produced by stellar populations younger than 0.6 Gyr. In contrast,\nthe 12um emission in weak AGN (L[OIII]<10^7 L_sun) is produced by older stars,\nwith ages of ~1-3 Gyr. We find that L_[12um] linearly correlates with stellar\nmass for SF galaxies. At fixed 12um luminosity, weak AGN deviate toward higher\nmasses since they tend to be hosted by massive, early-type galaxies with older\nstellar populations. Star-forming galaxies and weak AGN follow different\nL_[12um]-SFR (star formation rate) relations, with weak AGN showing excess 12um\nemission at low SFR (~0.02-1 M_sun/yr). This is likely due to dust grains\nheated by older stars. While the specific star formation rate (SSFR) of SF\ngalaxies is nearly constant, the SSFR of weak AGN decreases by ~3 orders of\nmagnitude, reflecting the very different star formation efficiencies between SF\ngalaxies and massive, early-type galaxies. Stronger type II AGN in our sample\n(L_[OIII]>10^7 L_sun), act as an extension of massive SF galaxies, connecting\nthe SF and weak AGN sequences. This suggests a picture where galaxies form\nstars normally until an AGN (possibly after a starburst episode) starts to\ngradually quench the SF activity.

We highlight the importance of self-shielding\nand of properly treating sub-resolution models in simulations. Most existing\nsimulations do not self-consistently incorporate these effects, which can lead\nto order-of-magnitude errors in the predicted cooling luminosity. Using a\ncombination of post-processing ionizing radiative transfer and re-simulation\ntechniques, we develop an approximation to the consistent evolution of the\nself-shielded gas. We quantify the dependence of the Lya cooling luminosity on\nhalo mass at z=3 for the simplified problem of pure gas accretion. While\ncooling in massive halos (without additional energy input from star formation\nand AGN) is in principle sufficient to produce L_alpha~10^43-10^44 erg s^-1\nblobs, this requires including energy released in gas of density sufficient to\nform stars, but which is kept 100% gaseous in our optimistic estimates.\nExcluding emission from such dense gas yields lower luminosities by up to one\nto two orders of magnitude at high masses, making it difficult to explain the\nobserved Lya blobs with pure cooling.

NGC 2146 is part of the\nSnapshot Hubble U-band Cluster Survey (SHUCS). The WFC3/F336W data has added\ncritical information to the available archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging\nset of NGC 2146, allowing us to determine ages, masses, and extinctions of the\nclusters in the Ruby Ring. These properties have then been used to investigate\nthe formation of this extraordinary system. We find evidence of a spatial and\ntemporal correlation between the central cluster and the clusters in the ring.\nThe latter are about 4 Myr younger than the central cluster, which has an age\nof 7 Myr. This result is supported by the H alpha emission which is strongly\ncoincident with the ring, and weaker at the position of the central cluster.\nFrom the derived total H alpha luminosity of the system we constrain the star\nformation rate density to be quite high, e.g. ~ 0.47 Msun/yr/kpc^2. The Ruby\nRing is the product of an intense and localised burst of star formation,\nsimilar to the extended cluster complexes observed in M51 and the Antennae, but\nmore impressive because is quite isolated. The central cluster contains only 5\n% of the total stellar mass in the clusters that are determined within the\ncomplex. The ring-like morphology, the age spread, and the mass ratio support a\ntriggering formation scenario for this complex.

We present and model 11 new spectroscopic observations of\nthe double-peaked profile taken between 2010 March and 2011 March. This series\nof observations was motivated by the finding that in 2010 March the flux in the\ndouble-peaked line was again strong, becoming, in 2010 December, even stronger\nthan in the observations of a decade ago. We also discovered shorter timescale\nvariations than in the previous observations: (1) the first, of ~7 days, is\ninterpreted as due to \"reverberation\" of the variation of the ionizing source\nluminosity, and the timescale of 7 days as the light crossing time between the\nsource and the accretion disk; this new timescale and its interpretation\nprovides a distance between the emitting gas and the supermassive black hole\nand as such introduces a new constraint on its mass; (2) the second, of\napproximately 5 months, was attributed to the rotation of a spiral arm in the\ndisk, which was found to occur on the dynamical timescale. We use two accretion\ndisk models to fit theoretical profiles to the new data, both having\nnon-axisymmetric emissivities produced by the presence of an one-armed spiral.\nOur modeling constrains the rotation period for the spiral to be approximately\n18 months.

In this paper we develop a general\nmethod for computing probabilities of very rare events (e.g. small fusion\ncross-sections) for processes described by Langevin dynamics. As we demonstrate\nwith numerical examples as well as an exactly solvable model, our method can\nconverge to the desired answer at a rate which is orders of magnitude faster\nthan that achieved with direct simulations of the process in question.\n", "categories": "Nuclear Theory "}

{"id": 633844, "title": "Detailed description of exclusive muon capture rates using realistic\n  two-body forces", "abstract": "  Starting from state-by-state calculations of exclusive rates of the ordinary\nmuon capture (OMC), we evaluated total muon-capture rates for a set of light-\nand medium-weight nuclear isotopes. We employed a version of the proton-neutron\nquasi-particle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA, for short) which uses as\nrealistic nuclear forces the Bonn C-D one boson exchange potential. Special\nattention was paid on the percentage contribution to the total muon-capture\nrate of specific low-spin multipolarities resulting by summing over the\ncorresponding multipole transitions. The nuclear method used offers the\npossibility of estimating separately the individual contributions to the total\nand partial rates of the polar-vector and axial-vector components of the weak\ninteraction Hamiltonian for each accessible final state of the daughter\nnucleus. One of our main goals is to provide a reliable description of the\ncharge changing transitions matrix elements entering the description of other\nsimilar semileptonic nuclear processes like the charged-current\nneutrino-nucleus reactions, the electron capture on nuclei, the single\n\\b{eta}-decay mode, etc., which play important role in currently interesting\nlaboratory and astrophysical applications like the neutrino-detection through\nlepton- nucleus interaction probes, and neutrino-nucleosynthesis. Such results\ncan be also be useful in various ongoing muon-capture experiments at PSI,\nFermilab, JPARC and RCNP.\n", "categories": "Nuclear Theory "}

An increase of the excitation function of\n$K^+$ multiplicities obtained in heavy ($Au+Au$) over light ($C+C$) systems\nwhen going far below threshold which has been observed by the KaoS\nCollaboration strongly favours a soft equation of state. This observation holds\ndespite of the influence of an in-medium kaon potential predicted by effective\nchiral models which is necessary to reproduce the experimental $K^+$ yields.\n", "categories": "Nuclear Theory "}
